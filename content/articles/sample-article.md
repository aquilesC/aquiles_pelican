Summary: A brief introduction to my new static website built with Pelican and TailwindCSS.

# Welcome to My New Website

I'm excited to introduce my new personal website, built with Pelican and styled with TailwindCSS. This site represents a modern approach to personal publishing, combining clean design with fast, static site generation.

## Why Pelican?

Pelican offers a great balance between simplicity and flexibility. It's perfect for:
- Fast loading times
- Easy content management

## Design Philosophy

The design is inspired by editorial websites that prioritize reading comfort and visual clarity. Key principles include:
- High contrast text for readability
- Generous whitespace
- Responsive design
- Accessibility first

## What's Next?

I'll be adding more articles, sharing my work, and updating content regularly. Stay tuned!
